# Web design

I created a dashboard website, and plotted weather data, in order to visualize it on the web.

## Setup
In building this dashboard, I created individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. I also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.


## Visualizations 
Four visualization pages, each with:

* A descriptive title and heading tag.
* The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
* A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
* A Comparisons page that:

Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
Uses a bootstrap grid for the visualizations.



### Below are some of the graphs:
